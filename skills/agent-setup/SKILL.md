description: Set up a repository for effective agent-assisted development. Orchestrates five opt-in phases — curated skill recommendations based on the detected stack (web, React Native, iOS, Android, Python, …), a context-management playbook written into CLAUDE.md, a permissions allowlist, deterministic hooks (including write-protection for vendored third-party skills), and supply-chain guards (minimum-release-age for bun/pnpm/uv). Use when the user asks to "set up this repo for agents", "agent setup", "what skills should I add", "recommend skills", or is bootstrapping agent tooling in a new or existing project.

# agent-setup — make a repo agent-ready

Run an opt-in, phase-by-phase setup. **Present each phase's plan, get confirmation, then apply.**
The user may skip any phase. Never apply anything unconfirmed.

## Phase 0 — Assess current state

Before proposing anything, read what exists:

- `CLAUDE.md` (root and `.claude/`) — does it exist? Does it already have a context-management section?
- `.claude/settings.json` / `.claude/settings.local.json` — existing permissions and hooks?
- `skills-lock.json` — which skills are already installed?
- Package-manager config (`bunfig.toml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `[tool.uv]`) — release-age guard present?
- Stack markers (see [recommend.md](recommend.md) step 2).

On re-runs, every phase below outputs a **diff against current state**, not a fresh dump.
"Everything already configured" is a valid, common outcome.

## Phase 1 — Skills

Follow [recommend.md](recommend.md) end-to-end: load the vetted catalog (live-fetched from
wolff-skills) → detect stack(s) → diff against installed skills → compose one-skill-per-concern
within budget → present plan → confirm → install. This phase also runs standalone when the user
only asks for skill recommendations.

## Phase 2 — Context-management playbook → CLAUDE.md

Insert the playbook from [context-playbook.md](context-playbook.md) into the repo's `CLAUDE.md`
under a `## Context management` heading (create `CLAUDE.md` if absent; replace the section if it
already exists from a previous run).

**Be honest about enforcement tiers when presenting this phase:**

| Tier | Mechanism | Reliability |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Convention | CLAUDE.md instruction | Soft — followed most of the time |
| Automation | Hook in settings.json | Hard — harness-executed, always fires |
| Impossible | e.g. "at exactly N% context, do X" | No context-% hook event exists — do not write fake-precision rules |

Tailor the playbook lightly to the repo (e.g. reference the repo's actual test command, mention
`/handoff` only if the handoff skill is installed or was accepted in Phase 1).

## Phase 3a — Permissions allowlist

Propose pre-approving common **safe, read-only** commands in `.claude/settings.json` to reduce
permission-prompt fatigue. Baseline (tailor to the detected stack):

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(git status:*)",
      "Bash(git log:*)",
      "Bash(git diff:*)",
      "Bash(git branch:*)",
      "Bash(ls:*)",
      "Bash(rg:*)",
      "Bash(find:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Add stack-specific read-only entries (e.g. `Bash(bun test:*)`, `Bash(npx tsc --noEmit:*)`,
`Bash(pytest:*)`) **only** if the user opts in — test runners execute project code, so they're a
step up in trust. Never propose allowlisting write/network/destructive commands
(`rm`, `curl`, `git push`, deploy commands).

Merge into existing `settings.json` — never clobber existing permissions or other keys.

## Phase 3b — Hooks (deterministic automations)

Offer a **modest** set — hooks run on every matching event, so each one must earn its place:

1. **PreCompact snapshot** — before any compaction, append a one-line state marker to a scratch
   file so post-compact sessions can recover intent:

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "PreCompact": [
         {
           "matcher": "",
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "mkdir -p .claude/state && date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M compacted' >> .claude/state/session-log.txt"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **SessionStart todo surfacing** — if the repo keeps a `TODO.md` or handoff doc, cat it at
   session start so resumed sessions begin with state:

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "SessionStart": [
         {
           "matcher": "",
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "test -f .claude/state/handoff.md && cat .claude/state/handoff.md || true"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Vendored-skill write protection** (recommended whenever `skills-lock.json` exists) — a
   PreToolUse hook that **blocks** any Edit/Write to installed third-party skill files. This is
   the hard-tier enforcement of the "vendored skills are read-only" convention — it stops agents,
   reviewers, and refactor sweeps from modifying files that `npx skills update` will clobber:

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "PreToolUse": [
         {
           "matcher": "Edit|Write",
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty' | { read -r f; if [ -f skills-lock.json ] && printf '%s' \"$f\" | grep -qE '\\.(claude|agents|cursor|github)/skills/'; then echo 'Blocked: vendored third-party skill (tracked in skills-lock.json). Edits are overwritten by npx skills update — write your own skill or PR upstream instead.' >&2; exit 2; fi; exit 0; }"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   Exit code 2 blocks the tool call and feeds the message back to the agent. Escape hatch: the
   user edits manually outside the agent, or temporarily disables the hook.

Present each hook individually; merge into existing `settings.json` hooks without clobbering.
If `.claude/state/` is introduced, add it to `.gitignore` (ask first — some teams want handoff
docs committed).

## Phase 4 — Supply-chain guards

Check (and on opt-in, fix) **minimum-release-age** protection for the repo's package manager, so
freshly published — possibly compromised — package versions can't be installed for N days:

| Manager | Detected by | Guard | Mechanism |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| bun | `bunfig.toml` / `bun.lock` | `[install] minimumReleaseAge = 259200` (3 days, seconds) in `bunfig.toml` | **Rolling** — enforced on every install, including CI/Vercel |
| pnpm | `pnpm-lock.yaml` | `minimumReleaseAge: 4320` (3 days, minutes) in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | **Rolling** |
| npm | `package-lock.json` | none rolling — `before` config is a static timestamp | Flag the limitation; suggest migrating to bun/pnpm if the user cares |
| uv | `uv.lock` | `exclude-newer` in `[tool.uv]` — static RFC3339 date | Static — note it must be refreshed periodically (e.g. by the update routine) |
| cargo / others | `Cargo.lock` etc. | no native equivalent | Mention; nothing to apply |

Procedure:

1. Detect the manager(s); read the existing config — if a guard is already set, report and move on.
2. If missing, propose the guard with a 3-day default (user may pick another window).
3. **Pair with the update flow**: a release-age guard means routine `update` commands must respect
   it or builds break later. For bun repos, this is exactly what the `update-deps` skill handles
   (`bun update --latest --minimum-release-age=259200`) — install it in Phase 1 if not already.
4. Remind that the guard only protects installs that go through the lockfile path — `npx`/`bunx`
   one-offs (including `npx skills` itself) execute fresh packages outside it. Prefer pinned
   versions for recurring scripted `npx` use.

## Final report

End with a summary table: phase → applied / skipped / already configured, plus exact files touched.
Remind the user that `settings.json` changes take effect on the next session.

## Out of scope

- Anything destructive or that weakens safety (allowlisting write/network commands, auto-approve modes).
- CI/CD, git hooks (husky etc.), or editor config — different concern, different tools.
- Modifying the user's global `~/.claude/` config beyond suggesting global-scope skill installs.
